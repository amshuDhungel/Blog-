            <h2>Lionel Messi</h2>
            <p>Lionel Andrés Messi[note 1] (Spanish pronunciation: [ljoˈnel anˈdɾes ˈmesi] (listen); born 24 June 1987),
                is an Argentine professional footballer who plays as a forward for Ligue 1 club Paris Saint-Germain and
                captains the Argentina national team. Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Messi
                has won a record seven Ballon d'Or awards,[note 2] a record six European Golden Shoes, and in 2020 was
                named to the Ballon d'Or Dream Team. Until leaving the club in 2021, he had spent his entire
                professional career with Barcelona, where he won a club-record 35 trophies, including ten La Liga
                titles, seven Copa del Rey titles and four UEFA Champions Leagues. A prolific goalscorer and creative
                playmaker, Messi holds the records for most goals in La Liga (474), most goals in a La Liga and European
                league season (50), most hat-tricks in La Liga (36) and the UEFA Champions League (8), and most assists
                in La Liga (192), a La Liga season (21) and the Copa América (17). He also holds the record for most
                international goals by a South American male (90). Messi has scored over 780 senior career goals for
                club and country, and has the most goals by a player for a single club. </p><br>
            <p>An Argentine international, Messi holds the national record for appearances and is also the country's
                all-time leading goalscorer. At youth level, he won the 2005 FIFA World Youth Championship, finishing
                the tournament with both the Golden Ball and Golden Shoe, and an Olympic gold medal at the 2008 Summer
                Olympics. His style of play as a diminutive, left-footed dribbler drew comparisons with his compatriot
                Diego Maradona, who described Messi as his successor. After his senior debut in August 2005, Messi
                became the youngest Argentine to play and score in a FIFA World Cup in 2006, and reached the final of
                the 2007 Copa América, where he was named young player of the tournament. As the squad's captain from
                August 2011, he led Argentina to three consecutive finals: the 2014 FIFA World Cup, for which he won the
                Golden Ball, and the 2015 and 2016 Copa América, winning the Golden Ball in the 2015 edition. After
                announcing his international retirement in 2016, he reversed his decision and led his country to
                qualification for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, a third-place finish at the 2019 Copa América, and won the
                2021 Copa América, while winning the Golden Ball and Golden Boot award for the latter. This achievement
                would see him receive a record seventh Ballon d'Or in 2021.</p>

            <h2>Cristiano Ronaldo</h2>
            <p>Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro GOIH ComM (Portuguese pronunciation: [kɾiʃˈtjɐnu ʁɔˈnaɫdu]; born 5
                February 1985) is a Portuguese professional footballer who plays as a forward for Premier League club
                Manchester United and captains the Portugal national team. Widely regarded as one of the greatest
                players of all time, Ronaldo has won five Ballon d'Or awards[note 3] and four European Golden Shoes, the
                most by a European player. He has won 32 trophies in his career, including seven league titles, five
                UEFA Champions Leagues, and the UEFA European Championship. Ronaldo holds the records for most
                appearances (183), goals (140), and assists (42) in the Champions League, goals in the European
                Championship (14), international goals (117), and international appearances by a European (191). He is
                one of the few players to have made over 1,100 professional career appearances, and has scored over 800
                official senior career goals for club and country. </p><br>
            <p>Ronaldo began his senior career with Sporting CP, before signing with Manchester United in 2003, aged 18,
                winning the FA Cup in his first season. He would also go on to win three consecutive Premier League
                titles, the Champions League and the FIFA Club World Cup; at age 23, he won his first Ballon d'Or.
                Ronaldo was the subject of the then-most expensive association football transfer when he signed for Real
                Madrid in 2009 in a transfer worth €94 million (£80 million), where he won 15 trophies, including two La
                Liga titles, two Copa del Rey, and four Champions Leagues, and became the club's all-time top
                goalscorer. He won back-to-back Ballons d'Or in 2013 and 2014, and again in 2016 and 2017, and was
                runner-up three times behind Lionel Messi, his perceived career rival. In 2018, he signed for Juventus
                in a transfer worth an initial €100 million (£88 million), the most expensive transfer for an Italian
                club and for a player over 30 years old. He won two Serie A titles, two Supercoppe Italiana, and a Coppa
                Italia, before returning to Manchester United in 2021.</p>
